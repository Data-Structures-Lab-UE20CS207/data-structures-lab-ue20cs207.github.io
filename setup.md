## Setup for Students

### Setting up your GitHub accounts with PES email IDs

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} Account with your MS Teams college email address (your email ID will be of the form **\<SRN\>@pesuonline.onmicrosoft.com** - check [PESU Academy](https://www.pesuacademy.com/Academy/){:target="_blank"} if you have forgotten)

2. Create a username of the form `SRN-firstname`, where SRN is in all caps and firstname is in all lowercase. For example, if your SRN is **PES1UG20CS001** and your name is **Aman**, your username must be `PES1UG20CS001-aman`

3. Verify your account by checking your [email](https://outlook.office365.com){:target="_blank"} for the launch code

### Joining a Classroom

1. For every assignment released, you will be given a GitHub classroom link.

2. Click on the link and accept the assignment.

3. You will be asked to identify youself from a list of your SRNs. **Please do not skip this step**, as it is mandatory to link your GitHub account to your SRN.

## Setup for Teachers

### Step 1: Creating an Account on GitHub Classroom

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account that has been made an owner of the organisation [Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207](https://github.com/Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207). Please contact the TAs if you haven't been added.

2. Visit [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and click on Sign In. You will be redirected to a page that looks like this. Sign in with the same GitHub account that has been added to the organisation.

3. Once signed in, you should see a landing page with all your classrooms (empty for newly linked classroom accounts).

### Step 2: Creating a New Classroom

Follow these steps if the TA's have not created a classroom for a section. If this process has been done already, skip to [Creating an assignment](#create-assignment).

1. Click on the "Create your first classroom" button. If your account has been added to the organisation correctly, you should see the **Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207** organisation.

    <img src="/assets/images/GitHub_classroom_create_new.png" alt="GitHub_classroom_create_new" style="zoom:30%; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;" />

2. Select the organisation **Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207**. You will be asked to name the classroom. Please follow the naming convention **Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207-\<class\>-\<capital_section\>**. For example, to create a classroom for 3A, name the classroom **Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207-3-A**. For the demo here, a classroom called **Data-Structures-Lab-UE20CS207-3-Z** has been created.

    <img src="/assets/images/GitHub_classroom_name.png" alt="GitHub_classroom_name" style="zoom:30%; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;" />

3. Once successfully created, you will be taken to a "Success" page. If you have other collaborators (teachers, TAs) helping with **this class**, make sure that they are admins of the GitHub organisation and then copy the link of the classroom and send it to them personally.

4. The final step in creating a classroom is to add a list of students mapped to their SRNs.

    <img src="/assets/images/GitHub_classroom_roster.png" alt="GitHub_classroom_roster" style="zoom:30%; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;" />

    Since PES does not use a Learning Management System to manage all the students, scroll down to the bottom of the page and upload a CSV of all the students in your classroom. Once uploaded, the names and SRNs should show up in the text box.

    <img src="/assets/images/GitHub_classroom_names.png" alt="GitHub_classroom_names" style="zoom:30%; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;" />

    If successful, you should be taken to the classroom's home page.
